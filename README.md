# dailybook
This project displays a random excerpt from the book Tao Te Ching on the left side of your screen each day using a Python script. It features a Tkinter-based banner overlay that is scheduled to run daily via macOS's launchd (using the .plist file provided), cron for Linux, or Task Scheduler for Windows.
